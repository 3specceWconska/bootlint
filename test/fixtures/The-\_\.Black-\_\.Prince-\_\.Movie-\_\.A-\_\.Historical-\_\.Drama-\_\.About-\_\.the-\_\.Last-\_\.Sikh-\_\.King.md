The Black Prince movie depicts the historical events that shaped the life of Duleep Singh, who was born in Lahore in 1838 and became the ruler of the Sikh Empire at the age of five after the death of his father, Maharajah Ranjit Singh. However, his reign was short-lived, as the British East India Company invaded and annexed Punjab in 1849, after winning the First and Second Anglo-Sikh Wars. Duleep Singh was deposed and separated from his mother, Maharani Jinda, who was imprisoned and exiled by the British. He was also forced to sign away his sovereign rights and convert to Christianity.
  
Duleep Singh was taken under the care of Dr. John Login, a British surgeon and official, who brought him to England in 1854. There he met Queen Victoria, who took a liking to him and treated him as a friend and an adopted son. He also mingled with the royal family and the British aristocracy, and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He married Bamba MÃ¼ller, a German-Ethiopian woman, in 1864 and had six children with her. He also had two more children with his second wife, Ada Douglas Wetherill, whom he married in 1889.
  
However, Duleep Singh was not happy with his situation. He felt alienated from his culture and identity, and yearned to return to India and reclaim his throne. He also resented the British for their injustice and oppression of his people. He reconnected with his mother in 1861, who told him about his Sikh heritage and encouraged him to fight for his rights. He also met with other Indian nationalists and revolutionaries who supported his cause. He renounced Christianity and reconverted to Sikhism in 1886.
  
Duleep Singh tried to travel to India several times, but was always stopped by the British authorities. He also sought the help of other European powers, such as Russia and France, but they did not offer much assistance. He died in Paris in 1893, without fulfilling his dream of returning to his homeland.
